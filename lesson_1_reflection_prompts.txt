How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

	It reduces the searching time and easier to spot the difference.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

	It is easier to see if the change went wrong. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	I can decide about the size of the commit, but I can forget to save it.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	It is faster and easier to compare the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	I can use the git log to list out the whole hystory and then git diff to
	check the difference between two commit.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can go back to previous version where I didn't make the changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I don't know yet.
