When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I need some help for example.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I want to make commits only when it is really necessary.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Clones are exactly the same. I would use them when I need a copy of a project.
	Forks are for contributors and contain the whole repository and all branches.
	Each branch within the fork correspond to several kind of things and they can be merged.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Because I am up to date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I think everything would be easier.
